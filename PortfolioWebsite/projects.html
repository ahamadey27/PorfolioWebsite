                <h2>Simple ECommerce App</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a full-featured eCommerce web application that allows users to browse products, 
                    add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases through a streamlined checkout process. 
                    The app features user authentication, product management, and order tracking, providing a realistic 
                    online shopping experience. It is designed with a clean, responsive interface for both desktop and mobile users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built using ASP.NET Core Web API and Entity Framework Core, the backend supports secure user registration, 
                    JWT-based authentication, and robust CRUD operations for products and orders. The project demonstrates 
                    best practices in RESTful API design, database modeling, and secure user management, making it a solid 
                    foundation for scalable eCommerce solutions.
